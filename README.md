### About the project

The motivation behind this project was to get practice with the python Turtle module and learn some python features such as dataclasses, decorators and Object Oriented Programming concepts. Also, I was able to explore the library `PrettyTable`.

### Prerequisites

Before to get start the, you must install these tools on your machine:
[GIT](https://git-scm.com/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) (if it's not installed along with python).

### üéÆ Running the game

```bash
# Cloning repository
$ git clone https://github.com/EngComp-Henrique/Turtle-Racing-Game.git

# Accessing project folder
$ cd Turtle-Racing-Game

# Installing libraries
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

# Executing
$ python3 main.py
```

### üõ† Tecnologies

The tools used to build this project were:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html)
- [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

### Future features

- [ ] Add docs
- [ ] Add GUI interface to get user data and inputs
- [ ] Add bar graph with the victories of the turtles
- [ ] Add exceptions to get errors:
    - [ ] People younger than 18 won't be able to bet
